<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have spent the last 15 years working within Financial services fields, 
  having studied various areas of financial processes, financial crime & compliance scenarios, I now feel
  it is time for a change.</p>

<p>So I took the plunge in 2019 & went down the route of finding something else to get involved in,
  I have also been a key person when it comes to changes & implementation of software systems being introduced
   in the companies I have worked for, and found this to be of interest & enjoyed taking part.
</p>

<p>So I decided to start this career change by enrolling for an open degree in line with Computer Science fields.</p>
